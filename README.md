# eval_document_co-clustering

Traditional topic modeling schemes including Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic
Analysis (LSA) have been widely adopted in the social sciences, but are typically unable to
cope well with short and noisy texts. Several document co-clustering algorithms have been proposed
as potential solutions, but their performances have seldom been compared systematically. Therefore,
the first task is to assess the effectiveness of existing document co-clustering
algorithms, using LDA as a baseline for comparison.
